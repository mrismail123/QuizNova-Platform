# 📘 Project: QuizNova — MCQ Test Web App (Frontend Only)

**QuizNova** is a lightweight web application that allows teachers to create multiple-choice question (MCQ) exams and share them with students via a simple link. Students can take tests directly in the browser with a clean, distraction-free interface.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is an early version of the platform. There is currently **no backend** — all data is stored in the browser using `localStorage`. Future updates will include user authentication, result tracking, and database integration.
